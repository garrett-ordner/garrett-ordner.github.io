We&#8217;re ready to start working toward an axiomatic definition of probability.  First, however, we take a rather painful detour through the realm of Borel fields.  Please forgive me.  As a treat, this lesson does end with a listing of the axioms of probability.  The Powerpoint version of this presentation can be downloaded here: [Presentation 1-2-1 Borel Fields and Kolmogorov Axioms](http://sites.localhost/wp/statssimplified/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Presentation-1-2-1-Borel-Fields-and-Kolmogorov-Axioms.pptx)

Note:  Casella and Berger don&#8217;t really distinguish Borel fields from the more general concept of sigma algebras, so neither does this lesson, but it&#8217;s not really relevant to future lessons.
