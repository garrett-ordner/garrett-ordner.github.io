<p>We’re ready to start working toward an axiomatic definition of probability.  First, however, we take a rather painful detour through the realm of Borel fields.  Please forgive me.  As a treat, this lesson does end with a listing of the axioms of probability.  The Powerpoint version of this presentation can be downloaded here: <a href="/lessons/Presentation-1-2-1-Borel-Fields-and-Kolmogorov-Axioms.pptx">Presentation 1-2-1 Borel Fields and Kolmogorov Axioms</a></p>

<p>Note:  Casella and Berger don’t really distinguish Borel fields from the more general concept of sigma algebras, so neither does this lesson, but it’s not really relevant to future lessons.</p>
