<p>Now we’re getting to the good stuff!  We’re not only taking a deeper dive into the axioms of probability, we’re also proving that a (relatively) simple function satisfies all three of the axioms and gives us an easier way to define probability.  I know some of this looks a little intimidating, but there are plenty of annotations to guide you through the math.  Plus, it’s fun!
